            <p class="info1">While in college, Brooklyn, NY native, Liam Vigoli started his appetite for
                making people happy through food. He sold hotdogs from a wagon, now our “Salad
                Wagon” on the side of 23rd st. in Manhattan, NYC. Eventually Vigoli’s was
                established in 1954. Using his Sicilian family recipes and his charming
                personality, he made his mark in New york. In 1958, Liam took a break from the
                restaurant business to pursue another business venture, Act One Limousine. Liam
                decided to hang onto the décor and sentimental gifts that adorned the restaurant
                walls. Good thing he did, because in 1965, his daughter, Alissa Cerami
                convinced Fred to reopen Cerami’s as business partners and bring back the
                nostalgic energy and look of the original Cerami’s with a norhtern flair. Literally
                growing up in the restaurant business, Alissa acquired a passion for cooking and
                entrepreneurship. With the desire of making people happy with good food and
                welcoming staff, Liam & Alissa make a great team.</p>
